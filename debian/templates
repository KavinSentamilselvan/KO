Template: libnss-ldap/confperm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: make configuration readable/writeable by owner only
 Should the libnss-ldap configuration file be readable and writable only by
 the file owner?
 .
 If you use passwords in your libnss-ldap configuration, it is usually a
 good idea to have the configuration set with mode 0600 (readable and
 writable only by the file's owner).
 .
 Note: As a sanity check, libnss-ldap will check if you have nscd installed
 and will only set the mode to 0600 if nscd is present.

Template: libnss-ldap/nsswitch
Type: note
_Description: nsswitch.conf is not managed automatically
 For this package to work, you need to modify your /etc/nsswitch.conf to
 use the ldap datasource.  There is an example file at
 /usr/share/doc/libnss-ldap/examples/nsswitch.ldap which can be used as an
 example for your nsswitch setup, or it can be copied over your current
 setup.
 .
 Also, before removing this package, it is wise to remove the ldap entries
 from nsswitch.conf to keep basic services functioning.

Template: shared/ldapns/base-dn
Type: string
_Default: dc=example,dc=net
_Description: distinguished name of the search base
 Please enter the distinguished name of the LDAP search base.  Many sites
 use the components of their domain names for this purpose.  For example,
 the domain "example.net" would use "dc=example,dc=net" as the
 distinguished name of the search base.

Template: libnss-ldap/dblogin
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: database requires login
 Does the LDAP database require login?
 .
 Answer this question affirmatively only if you can't retreive entries from
 the database without logging in.
 .
 Note: Under a normal setup, this is not needed.

Template: libnss-ldap/override
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: enable automatic configuration updates by debconf
 Should debconf automatically update libnss-ldap's configuration file?
 .
 libnss-ldap has been moved to use debconf for its configuration.
 .
 The file will be prepended with "###DEBCONF###"; you can disable the
 debconf updates by removing that line.
 .
 All new installations will have this by default.

Template: libnss-ldap/binddn
Type: string
_Default: cn=proxyuser,dc=example,dc=net
_Description: unprivileged database user
 Enter the name of the account that will be used to log in to the LDAP
 database.

Template: libnss-ldap/bindpw
Type: password
_Description: password for database login account
 Enter the password that will be used to log in to the LDAP database.

Template: shared/ldapns/ldap_version
Type: select
_Choices: 3, 2
Default: 3
_Description: LDAP version to use
 Please enter which version of the LDAP protocol ldapns is to use.  It is
 usually a good idea to set this to highest available version number.

Template: shared/ldapns/ldap-server
Type: string
_Default: ldap://127.0.0.1/
_Description: LDAP server Uniform Resource Identifier
 Please enter the URI of the LDAP server used. This is a string in the
 form ldap://<hostname or IP>:<port>/ . ldaps:// or ldapi:// can also
 be used. The port number is optional.
 .
 Note: It is usually a good idea to use an IP address; this reduces risks
 of failure in the event name service is unavailable.

Template: libnss-ldap/dbrootlogin
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: special LDAP privileges for root
 This option will allow tools that perform requests to the nss system
 with libnss-ldap as backend to return more information when called
 as root.
 .
 If you are using NFS mounted /etc or any other custom setup, you should
 disable this.

Template: libnss-ldap/rootbinddn
Type: string
Default: cn=manager,dc=example,dc=net
_Description: LDAP account for root
 This account will be used for nss requests with root privileges.
 .
 Note: For this to work the account needs permission to access the
 attributes in the LDAP directory that are related to the users' shadow
 entries as well as users' and groups' passwords.

Template: libnss-ldap/rootbindpw
Type: password
_Description: LDAP root account password
 This password will be used when libnss-ldap tries to login to the LDAP
 directory using the LDAP account for root.
 .
 The password will be stored in a separate file /etc/libnss-ldap.secret
 which will be made readable to root only.
 .
 Entering an empty password will re-use the old password.

Description: NSS module for using LDAP as a naming service
 This package provides a Name Service Switch module that allows your LDAP
 server to provide user account, group, host name, alias, netgroup, and
 basically any other information that you would normally get from /etc flat
 files or NIS.
 .
 This is a fork from libnss-ldap implementing structural design changes
 to fix, amongst other things, problems related to host name lookups and
 name lookups during booting.

This is nss-ldapd, a library for doging NSS name lookups using an LDAP server.

nss-ldapd is a fork from nss_ldap which was orignally written by Luke Howard
of PADL Software Pty Ltd. http://www.padl.com/OSS/nss_ldap.html

In 2006 Arthur de Jong of West Consuling forked the library to split it into a
thin NSS part and a server part. Most of the code was rewritten.

Arthur de Jong is both the upstream and Debian package maintainer, so there
are no differences between the Debian package and the upstream version.

The Debian package of nss-ldapd was partially based on packaging of the
libnss-ldap package. The libnss-ldap package was maintained by Ben Collins,
Davide Puricelli (evo), Sami Haahtinen and Stephen Frost.

2008-05-02 20:52  arthur

	* [r720] remove checking for first entry and always return
	  NSS_STATUS_RETURN when no more data is available in the netgroup
	  (this has the side effect of not returning NSS_STATUS_NOTFOUND
	  for non-existing netgroups but seems to be what other NSS modules
	  do) to properly handle empty netgroups

2008-05-02 15:57  arthur

	* [r719] add file for testing nslcd/group.c

2008-05-02 15:55  arthur

	  whenever any of the ldap_*() functions return LDAP_UNAVAILABLE

2008-04-25 16:40  arthur

	* [r701] implement new timing mechanism for retries to quickly fail

	  HAVE_ETHER_ATON_R macros

2008-04-23 20:53  arthur

2008-04-18 19:57  arthur

	* [r677] instead of using the dict module to build a cache just
	  store the values in an fixed-sized array because no more than 9
	  attributes are currently retrieved from an entry and we never
	  retrieve the same value more than once (so the cache is useless)

	* [r676] add note about freed values

2008-04-17 21:12  arthur

	* [r659] no problem to shout a little with failed tests

2008-04-05 13:35  arthur

2008-04-05 11:21  arthur

	* [r657] partial support for reading AD date format for pwdLastSet
	  attribute

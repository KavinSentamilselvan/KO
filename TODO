probably before we can call this stable
---------------------------------------
* implement _nss_ldap_initgroups_dyn()
* fix usage of strerror() as it is not thread safe
* error out quickly when the LDAP server is down
* fix race condition when setting signal mask in common/tio.c
  (using pthread_sigmask() adds a dependency on the pthread library,
  maybe we should switch back to stdio)
* find problem with reachability of LDAP server
* get root/nonroot connections working

other items
-----------
* set up (test) connection to LDAP server before creating socket
* Debian packaging: maybe remove stuff from /etc/nsswitch.conf on remove or
  purge (maybe prompt?)
* probably document that you should use libpam-ldap for authentication without
  exposing the passwords through NSS
* make a test suite (instructions for setting up environment (server), LDIF
  file, nsswitch.conf and nss-ldapd.conf)
* write more unit tests
* maybe support bootparams (check README also)
* maybe support publickey (check README also)
* maybe support netmasks (check README also)
* reserve some threads in the server for root users (probably set up
  connection pools) (we currently have a connection per thread)
* maybe implement a connection object in the myldap module that is shared
  by different sessions (sessions need to be cleaned up)
* add sanity checking code (e.g. not too large buffer allocation and checking
  that host, user, etc do not contain funky characters) in all server modules
* implement running under a different uid/gid (maybe chroot jail)
* maybe remove dh_makeshlibs from debian/rules (probably not needed)
* include a generic init script
* log some statistics: "passwd=100 shadow=10 host=20 rpc=10" (10 req/minute)
* in the server: once the request is done pass the flushing of the buffers to
  a separate thread so our workers are available to handle new requests
* reconfigure or upgrade of Debian package should restart nslcd instead of
  stop and later on start
* tune the filter and parameter buffer sizes
* maybe document how to set up automounting in LDAP (Linux and Solaris)
* make sure to translate timelimit 0 into timelimit -1 where needed
* split out idle checking into separate function so we may be able to call it
  periodically from elsewhere (e.g. the main loop)
* add an option to create an extra socket somewhere (so it may be used with
  chroot jails)
* make number of threads/connections configurable in config
* make I/O timeout between NSS lib and daemon configurable with configure
* ethers: also look in ipHostNumber attribute to look up an IPv4 (IPv6)
  address and return it as an alternative entry
* protocols/rpc: the description attribute should be used as an alias?
* do more checks with failing LDAP connections (e.g. killing connections)
* maybe make myldap code thread-safe (use locking)
* review changes in nss_ldap and merge any useful changes
* maybe rate-limit LDAP entry warnings
* consider returning the canonical value as it is stored in LDAP, not
  the requested value (they can differ in case)
* test non-ASCII characters in fields (mostly cn)
* implement attribute defaults (for when they're missing from the directory)
* implement attribute overrides (to always return a specific value, not matter what the directory says)

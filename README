LDAP NAMESERVICE SWITCH LIBRARY
===============================

This is the nss_ldap library, an LDAP module for the Solaris Nameservice
Switch (NSS), the GNU libc NSS, and the ISC BIND IRS (used on BSDI
and IRS).

The LDAP schema used is described in RFC 2307

Insert this:

passwd:     files nis ldap
group:      files nis ldap

or something similar in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

The source code is distributed under the GNU General Library Public Licence
(see COPYING.LIB).

Platforms this has been built under:

        o Linux 2.x
        o Solaris 2.4, 2.6, 7, 8
        o FreeBSD BIND 8.x (not useful unless you recompile libc)
        o AIX 4.3.3 with IRS

If you are willing to use an older, and possibly buggy, version
of nss_ldap, you *might* find patches to get it to work with the
"real" FreeBSD nsswitch at http://www.nectar.com/freebsd/nsswitch.

To install:

% ./configure
% make
% make install

NB: you need to use GNU make! (often called gmake or gnumake)

1. Installation
---------------

You need to ensure libnss_ldap.so.1 (or nss_ldap.so.1, for Solaris) is in
/usr/lib.

2. Building shared LDAP client libraries
----------------------------------------

You can build a position independent LDAP client library by compiling
-fPIC and linking with -shared, or downloading the Mozilla or Netscape
LDAP SDKs. Note that OpenLDAP only appears to build shared libraries
on some platforms (apparently not Solaris?). To build these, configure
with --enable-shared.

Q: Using the Netscape LDAP library with pam_ldap on Solaris 8
- aka Solaris 2.8 - fails to link properly! David Begley writes:

There are two releases of the Netscape LDAP library, one marked
for Solaris 8 and the other marked for Solaris 2.6 - the additional
catch is that the Solaris 8 library is a 64-bit library (this is marked
on Netscape's site) whilst the other is a 32-bit library.

It doesn't matter if you have a 64-bit UltraSPARC processor running
the 64-bit Solaris kernel, if your compiler only works with 32-bit
objects then it won't successfully link the 64-bit Solaris 8
Netscape LDAP library.

GCC (up to version 2.95.2) does not work properly with 64-bit objects
under Solaris, so just use the Solaris 2.6 (32-bit) Netscape LDAP
library and everything should be fine.

Q: Can I use a third-party client LDAP library (such as Netscape's)
on Solaris 7? David Begley writes:

Yes, but if you have the Solaris 7 LDAP library installed (package
SUNWlldap or SUNWldapx) configure will find it before the third-party
library - in this case, you can't rely on the auto-lib-type detection of
configure and must use the "--with-ldap-lib=" parameter.

Q: Why does linking fail on Solaris 2.6 (complaining about
relocations remaining against libcrypt)? David Begley
writes:

In short, the problem is that GCC is looking for a shared libcrypt
(in response to the "--shared" parameter) which doesn't exist on
Solaris 2.6 (but does on Solaris 7).  The fix is quite simple, use
"-G" instead of "--shared" (could this be a GCC bug?).  This change
should already be included in newer versions of pam_ldap.

It doesn't look like libcrypt is even needed if you're using the
Netscape LDAP client library (maybe it's required for OpenLDAP?).

Scott M. Stone <sstone@foo3.com> writes:
Your openldap libs *and* your SSL/RSAREF libs must be DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
or neither nss_ldap nor pam_ldap will work.

3. glibc 2.0 compatibility
--------------------------

Current versions of the nss_ldap library are designed to work with
glibc 2.1, not glibc 2.0. They _may_ work with glibc 2.0. YMMV.

4. RFC2307BIS
-------------

Compiling with -DRFC2307BIS adds rfc2307bis support, which at the
moment just gets you support for groups with distinguished name
members (instead of login names). A posixGroup can thus have the
both memberUid and uniqueMember attributes.

5. Building under FreeBSD
-------------------------

Here's what I do to build it under FreeBSD. You will need to
link it into libbind.a for it actually to be useful.

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/bind -DPIC"
export CPPFLAGS
CFLAGS=$CPPFLAGS # this is weird
export CFLAGS
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
LIBS="-lbind_r -lgnuregex -lsasl -lkrb"
export LDFLAGS LIBS
./configure
make

6. Solaris, shadowAccount
-------------------------

Joerg Paysen notes:

> I think its extremly important that you have a
> /etc/shadow file so that an ObjectClass shadowAccount
> will be created in the ldap database. My experience is
> that without shadowAccount nss_ldap does not work on
> solaris!!

7. Secret file
--------------

If using /etc/ldap.secret, it must have a newline at the end
of the secret.

8. Mailing lists
----------------

To discuss nss_ldap and related technologies, you may
subscribe to the following mailing lists:

The README.SFU is slightly little out of date and off topic now.  I
originally wrote README.SFU when I modified nss_ldap and Luke Howard
integrated the patch into nss_ldap-150 I believe as a configure option.

There is now the ability to do schema mapping in nss_ldap and change which
attributes are used for LDAP lookups.  You have to use the following
configure option:

./configure --enable-schema-mapping [REST_OF_YOUR_OPTIONS_HERE]

Once nss_ldap is compiled then you edit your ldap.conf file and uncomment
the attribute mapping under the MSSFU section (use your favorite text editor
and search for MSSFU and you should find it).  Once you do that, and you
modify your nsswitch.conf, you should be off and running.

Let me know if you need anymore help.

Regards,
Andy.



*
*** Test systems specifications ***
*
This module has been tested and works with the following operating
system versions:

RedHat Linux 7.1, kernel 2.4.2-2, against Win2000 Server SP1 mixed-mode
RedHat Linux 6.2, kernel 2.2.17 (smp, custom), Win2000 Server SP1 mixed mode
RedHat Linux 6.1, kernel 2.2.17 (smp, custom), Win2000 Server SP1 mixed mode

The module should compile work with other *NIX/*BSD OS's, but your mileage 
may vary.

I believe there is a coding difference in certain applications between Red 
Hat 6.1, and versions 6.2 and greater.  When testing the modified module I 
used 'id [USERNAME]' to make sure that the correct information was being 
retrieved from the AD.  In Red Hat versions 6.2 or greater (7.0 not tested,
but it should be the same), 'id [USERNAME]' would only return UID, and primary
GID.  If [USERNAME] was logged in interactively and ran 'id' the command showed
UID, primary GID, and all other group memberships.

However, when running 'id [USERNAME]' in Red Hat 6.1, the command returned a 
"Segmentation Fault."  If the user is logged in interactively on 6.1, all of
the correct information is still retrieved.

I am going to check into this issue, but the module should still behave correctly
under 6.1.  Let me know if you find out anything different.
 

*
*** What was modified ***  
*
There is very little to modify in order to retrieve passwd and group 
information from a Windows 2000 Active Directory.

[Ed note: the patches are incorporated, so all you need to do is
 run ./configure --enable-mssfu-schema]

Supplied in the ./admods directory is the context diff of ldap-schema.h.  
This file shows the attributes that needed to be modified in order to 
use nss_ldap for user and group information on a Linux machine.  Besides
a slight modification of the Makefile, this is the only file that needs 
to be changed.

Below are the lines that need to be modified in the Makefile.  Just make 
the lines in your Makefile similar to the ones below.

nss_ldap_so_LDFLAGS = -shared -L/lib/libdb.so
LDFLAGS = -L/lib/libdb.so
NSS_LDAP_LDFLAGS = -enss_ldap_initialize -lsys -lcsys -lc -ldb
LIBS = -lldap -llber -lnsl -lresolv -ldb

The "-ldb" in NSS_LDAP_LDFLAGS and LIBS may not be necessary, but I 
wasn't about the change anything in the module after I had it working :)
Also, the -L switch should have the path to your libdb.so (e.g if libdb.so.3
is in /usr/local/lib then your LDFLAGS should have -L/usr/local/lib/libdb.so.3).


*
*** Building it ***
*
This is the procedure that was used to build this module. The ldap-schema.h
file include in this source tree has already been modified to work with 
SFUed Active Directory, so you do not need to modify that file.  The 
ldap-schema.diff file has been provided for illustration purposes so one 
knows what attributes have been modified.

1) make distclean
2) ./configure --with-ldap=openldap --libdir=/lib --enable-mssfu-schema
3) Modify Makefile so that the lines in Makefile are similar to those listed 
    above.
4) make install

That's it!


*
*** /etc/ldap.conf ***
*
Modify your /etc/ldap.conf file to match your Active Directory/LDAP 
configuration.  Unless you have changed your AD from the stock install, 
you should have the following RFC2307bis naming contexts in your 
ldap.conf file:

nss_base_passwd		cn=Users,dc=yourdomain,dc=com?one
nss_base_group		cn=Users,dc=yourdomain,dc=com?one

With the stock Active Directory, all users and groups are located in the 
cn=users container underneath your domain.  If your AD has been modified, 
then modify the naming contexts to suit your directory.

You should also set the PAM login attribute.  Mine is as follows:

pam_login_attribute	msSFUName

***********************************************************
**** README.paged *****************************************
***********************************************************

Purpose
-------

These  amendments  cause  all "getXXent"   calls  implemented  by
NSS_LDAP  to  request paging of results in  accordance  with  RFC
2696. 

If  you  are  using  LDAP searches  against  a  Microsoft  Active
Directory  database,  you  will  find  that  search  results  are
divided  into  "chunks".  A standard  "ldap_search"   against  an
untweaked AD returns a maximum of 1000 entries. To get more  than
that,  you have to either use an extended search with paging,  or
increase  the  query  policy limits on your AD.  If  you  have  a
large  number  of  users (we have over 30K)  raising  the  policy
limits that high is worrying.  

The  page  size requested is 1000 entries, and is  not  a  config
file item. However, it should be OK with any Active Directory.

Because  of the way the page control is used, any  LDAPv3  server
that  does  not  implement paging should  simply  ignore  it  and
return  entries as normal; however, I haven't been able  to  test
this.

Installing
----------

The  TAR file contains 3 context diff files and one extra C  file
(pagectrl. c)  that implements the standard API calls  for  paged
results  controls.  If your LDAP library supports  these  anyway,
you  shouldn't  need it, but I don't know of one that  does.  The
Sun  library  has the entry points, but I couldn't  get  them  to
work. 

1. Unpack the TAR file in your NSS LDAP directory.

2. Run "patch" to apply the 3 diff files. On my system that is:

	patch ldap-nss.c < ldap-nss.c.diff
	patch ldap-nss.h < ldap-nss.h.diff
	patch Makefile.in < Makefile.in.diff

3. Run  "configure" as specified in the  NSS  LDAP  installation
instructions, to recreate the Makefile.

4. Run "make clean"

5. Run "make"

You should now have a new nss_ldap.so ready to copy to /lib.

   nss-ldapd - NSS library for name lookups using LDAP

   nss-ldapd is a fork from nss_ldap which was orignally written by
   Luke Howard of PADL Software Pty Ltd.
   http://www.padl.com/OSS/nss_ldap.html

   In 2006 Arthur de Jong of West Consuling forked the library to
   split it into a thin NSS part and a server part. Most of the code
   was rewritten.

INTRODUCTION
============

This is the nss-ldapd library which is an NSS module to do name lookups to an
LDAP directory server. This library was forked from nss_ldap as provided by
Luke Howard of PADL Software Pty Ltd.

The library is currently work in progress.

The library allows distributing account, group, host and other configuration
information from a central LDAP server throughout an organisation. Because
LDAP is a hierarchical directory service, you can distribute the information
in a manner which reflects an organisational structure. This contrasts with
the flat, single domain policy of NIS. LDAP has many of the advantages of NIS+
(security and scalability) without the complexity. The system will work
alongside your existing NIS, NIS+, DNS and flat file name services.

This library consists of a thin NSS part that communicates with a local server
that handles the LDAP lookups. This simplifies the architecture and fixes some
scalability and locking problems with the original design.

improvements over nss_ldap
--------------------------

The fork from nss_ldap was done to implement some major design changes to fix
some structural problems in the library.

The biggest of those problems were host name lookups through LDAP (which could
cause deadlocks in most cases) and problems during booting (when the LDAP
server was not started or not yet reachable).

With nss-ldapd a number of refactoring steps were taken to simplify the code
and improve maintainability. Legacy code was removed and support for non-Linux
operating systems was initially removed to make the code more readable.
Portability will be re-added once the architecture stabilises.

The most practical improvements of nss-ldapd over nss_ldap are:

* the LDAP library is not loaded for every process doing LDAP lookups
* the number of connections to the LDAP server is limited, because not every
  process will open it's own connection (this problem is also mitigated by
  using nscd)
* hostname lookups should now be deadlock-free because the LDAP server name
  lookup no longer uses the ldap method

This package runs a local daemon that will be enabled during the boot process.
This daemon will handle connections to the LDAP server and accept NSS requests
from a named socket (/var/run/nslcd/socket). The thin NSS library will proxy
requests to the daemon.

Note that the package currently cannot be used on the same system alongside
nss_ldap.

supported C libraries
---------------------

This library currently only supports the GNU C Library. Support for other C
libraries has been removed in a refactoring step. Compatibility code and
support for other C libraries will be added in due time.

supported name databases
------------------------

Currently the following name databases are supported:

  aliases, ethers, group, hosts, netgroup, networks, passwd, protocols, rpc,
  services and shadow

Note that for when using IPv6 hosts entries, the addresses in the LDAP
directory must be in their preferred form. The same is true for mac addresses
for the ethers database. Otherwise the address->entry lookups will not work.
For more details see
  http://ldap.akbkhome.com/index.php/attribute/ipHostNumber.html
and
  http://ldap.akbkhome.com/index.php/attribute/macAddress.html

automounter map lookups (which are also defined in /etc/nsswitch.conf) are not
supported because the NSS interface is not used for these. The common autofs
implementation currently uses it's own method for getting the maps from LDAP.

The publickey, bootparams and netmasks are currently also unsupported. Some
investigation should be done if these are needed for anything, which
interfaces should be exported and how the LDAP schema part should look like.

supported LDAP libraries
------------------------

The current version of nss-ldapd has been developed with OpenLDAP 2.1.30 but
adding support for other LDAP libraries with similar interfaces should not be
too hard.

The server part of the code is however still being refactored and cleaned up
and the LDAP part is still subject to change and simplification.

unsupported features
--------------------

Since nss-ldapd was forked from nss_ldap most of the features that came with
nss_ldap are available. However, not all features have extensively tested yet
and may cause problems.

- attribute mapping should work but did not receive adequate testing
- attribute value default and overrides are not supported and may be removed
  in a coming release (but may reappear some day if requested)
- the manual page for nss-ldap.conf is horribly outdated and includes
  incorrect information
- paged results support is untested
- SSL/TLS support is untested but will be tested when the core code stabilizes
- the configuration file formats will change

In general, development is ongoing and a lot has to be cleaned up. The focus
is to have the functionality that is present be well tested and supported.


INSTALLATION
============

The nss-ldapd library uses autoconf and automake for building. Installing
nss-ldapd should be as simple as:

  % ./configure
  % make
  % make install

That said, it is a good idea to go first through the options of configure by
running:

  % ./configure --help

The last step (make install) should install the libnss_ldap.so.* file and the
daemon (nslcd). The boot process needs to be manually modified to start the
daemon at the right time.

paged results
-------------

The --enable-paged-results configure option implements handling of paged
results from the LDAP server in accordance with RFC2696.

When doing LDAP searches against a Microsoft Active Directory database, the
search results are divided into "chunks". A standard "ldap_search" against an
untweaked AD returns a maximum of 1000 entries. To get more than that, either
paging needs to be enabled or the page size needs to be increased in the
server. Enabling paging is obviously the cleaner solution.

The page size requested is 1000 entries, and is currently not configurable.
However, this should be fine in most set-ups.

Because of the way the page control is used, any LDAPv3 server that does not
implement paging should simply ignore it and return entries as normal;
however, this has not been fully tested yet.


CONFIGURATION
=============

After installation the name service switch configuration file
(/etc/nsswitch.conf) needs to be modified to do name lookups using the new
module. Also, the nss-ldapd configuration file (specified at configure time)
needs to be modified to contain to the correct LDAP configuration.

Editing nsswitch.conf consist mostly of adding ldap in the list of lookup
methods in the right place. See the nsswitch.conf(5) manual page for details
on the format. As an example the file could look a little like this:

  # the following contain normal unix user and group information
  passwd:         files ldap
  group:          files ldap
  shadow:         files ldap

  # hostname lookups through ldap before dns should work now
  hosts:          files ldap dns
  networks:       files ldap

  # normal flat-file definitions
  protocols:      files ldap
  services:       files ldap
  ethers:         files ldap
  rpc:            files ldap
  netgroup:       ldap

  # whether alias lookups really use NSS depends on the mail server
  aliases:        files ldap

Furthermore a LDAP configuration file (by default /etc/nss-ldapd.conf) needs
to be made. The location of this file can be specified with configure. See the
shipped manual page for details on the format and options. It should at least
contain something like:

  # the location of LDAP server
  uri ldap://localhost/

  # search base for all queries.
  base dc=example,dc=net

  # LDAP protocol version
  ldap_version 3


LDAP SCHEMA
===========

nss-ldapd supports a wide range of possible LDAP schema configurations.
Furthermore it can be customized heavily. The LDAP schema used is described in
RFC 2307. Groups with distinguished name members (instead of login names) (RFC
2307bis) is also supported. A posixGroup can thus have the both memberUid and
uniqueMember attributes.

default attributes
------------------

This paragraph describes the mapping between the NSS lookups and the LDAP
database. The mapping may be modified by changeging the nss-ldapd.conf
configuration file. See the nss-ldapd.conf(5) manual page for details.

using Microsoft Active Directory
--------------------------------

When using Microsoft Active Directory server (typically on Microsoft Windows
2000) some changes need to be made to the nss-ldapd.conf configuration file.
The default configuration file has some commented out attribute mappings for
such a setup.
